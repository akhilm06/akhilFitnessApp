# akhilFitnessApp
The goal of this application is solely to further my skills as a software engineer. As of writing this, I am a rising senior/senior in high school.

The application will present mile and kilometer paces when inputed a distance and time. 
Additionally, it will present a time to run specific workout distances after a pace is inputed (400 meter, 800 meter, etc.).
Last, it will predict a race time by the user inputing run distances and times along with effort given. 

While the project exists only to develop my skills, hopefully it may be useful to runners or athletes who may find use in the program.
